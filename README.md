```

You can start over again by running
```
./restart
```

# Checkpoints

## Checkpoint 1: "Forming" the basics

The frontend is created using Next.js. You can think of Next.js like React.js with some bells and whistles. With Next.js we can easily define routes, fetch data from the server using special functions, and make our deployments easier using "Vercel".

You might feel a bit scared looking at all these folders and files, but it'll make sense in a few minutes.

The only folders you should be concerned with are:

1. `src` stands for "source". This is where all the source code exists
2. `src/pages` - These are all the routes that your users will be able to navigate to
3. `src/components` - This is where we store reusable or logically separate chunks of our code so we can import and use them in our `pages`

For this checkpoint, we'll be looking at the following file: `pages/auth/register.jsx`.

### Task 1: The "handle" problem

We have a form that accepts a display name, and an email. However, we still need to add a "password" input and a "handle", with which the end-user can be easily identified.
Take a look at the "name" and "email" fields, and try to implement "password" and "handle" inputs. If you're feeling stuck, don't be afraid to use use online resources (cough, Chat, cough, GPT). But we highly recommend trying it out by yourself first to build an understanding of how forms are created.

Some helpful notes for you:

1. `onChange` attribute in the `<input />` tag informs you whenever the input value changes. Use that to set your variable.
2. The password text should not be visible! Try searching for "HTML input types"

Key learning:
How data flows from a user's keyboard into the actual application

### Task 2: Styling the register button

The registration button looks a bit weird, don't you think? Let's use Tailwind classes to spruce it up!
Tailwind is insanely easy to understand because each class (usually) applies just one style.

Check out some examples of Tailwind buttons online and try some stuff out yourself:
https://flowbite.com/docs/components/buttons/

We also want to make the button look faded when it is disabled. How can we do that?

Key learning:
How atomic CSS can be used to compose complex UIs in a very simple way

### Task 3: Branding!

Our product needs some branding. Can you figure out a nice way of adding a "Dog" icon to the top of our form?

Key learning:
How external resources can be added to a React application.

## Checkpoint 2: RESTing with APIs!

APIs are the backbone of web development. Whenever we want to do anything persistent (long-lasting), such as storing a user's information in a database, we have to make an API call to our application server.

### Task 1: Handling the button click

When users click on the "Register" button, we should be able to detect it.
Can you hook up the `<form>` tag to fire the `onFormSubmit` function?

### Task 2: Making your first API call

We will use the "fetch" function to submit our form to the backend. Although we haven't yet implemented the registration endpoint, we will be sending `name`, `email`, `handle`, and `password` in the body of our POST request.

Check out an example of `fetch` here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#examples

Key learning:
How data flows from the client (browser) to the server

## Checkpoint 3: Storing user details in the database

Our backend is written using Node.js. Again, the folder structure might seem a bit daunting at first, but here's what you need to know:

1. All the entities in our system, and their relationships are defined in the `models` folder
2. All the "endpoints" with which we can interact with the database are present in the `routes` folder
3. Whenever a request hits a "route", a controller (a function that can process requests) will be called. Controllers can interact with the database and return a response, which will be made available to the frontend. Controllers are present in a folder called `controllers`

We will learn more about database modelling in a future checkpoint. For now, this is created for you, and you have to focus on adding a route and a controller for this route.

### Task 1: Create a route for registering our user

We are firing a network request on `POST /user` from the frontend, so we should define the relevant route on the backend in `routes/users.js`.

Key learning:
API calls on the frontend are mapped to `routes` on the backend

### Task 2: Store the user in the database

We are using an ORM (a library that helps us interact easily with the underlying database) called Sequelize to store and retrieve data from the database. Can you write a query to create a new user using the request data?

Note how we have hashed the user's password since it's not a good practice to store plain-text passwords.

Key learning:
How data is stored in a database so it can last there long-term!

### Task 3: Return success or error to the frontend

Once we store the data successfully, we want to return a response. If the database entry was successful, return a successful response, else we return an error.
Look around in the codebase to see how we can do this!

Key learning:
Each route can either be successful or unsuccessful. We must account for both cases when creating a controller.

## Checkpoint 4: Let's write a tweet

For this checkpoint, we'll be looking at the following file: `/src/components/Tweet/ComposeTweet.jsx`.ÃÅ

After going through the above 3 checkpoints, now you have a basic understanding of how to create a form, apply styling to it, and how fire API, write a query to get and store the data inside the database

Now we going to learn how users would write a tweet on the UI?, excited üòÑ?

### Task 1: Writing a Tweet


We want users to write a tweet and submit the tweet on the UI. so how could we achieve that? 

- What do you think what kinds of HTML input elements should we use here for both? 

You have might have noticed this on Twitter when you write a tweet your text area content increases as per your content length. Now, according to what we had plan to implement will not work here, right? 

- So can you find the react library which will auto-resize our textarea?

- We want the user to submit their tweet so can you construct a button for the same?

- We also want to indicate the character count while the user writes their tweet along with the character limit we have set.

### Task 2: UI handling


Should the tweet submit button be visible when there is no tweet content present? Is that good user experience (UX)?

- Could you think? How could we disable the button when tweet content is empty?

Twitter has this constraint where it restricts the number of characters in a tweet.

- So can you think of how could we restrict the end-user when it reaches the limit

It would be good UX if you indicate something on the UI so that they know that tweet content length is about to reach the limit

- So can you make the character limit indicator red when a user reaches the limit? It is the good cherry on top of the cake functionality


### Task 3: Calling the API

We have constructed the basic UI to compose the tweet. Now we want to send the tweet content to our server, which will then stored it inside a database

So what is the first step to achieving the above result? Fire a request to some endpoint right?

- Which HTTP request method do you think is most appropriate to use here? 

What should be the behavior if the request succeeded and what if get failed? any thoughts?

How are we going to store the tweet content in the database, we can be going to learn in the next checkpoint


## Checkpoint 5: Storing tweet to database

### Task 1: Create a route which accepts tweet's metadata

Frontend will trigger a POST request, so we should define the relevant route which is parsed through the middlewares on the backend in routes/tweet.js.

### Task 2: Make changes in controller for storing the tweet

We have added a route, now it's time to make changes in controller tweet.js. Controller accepts the request and stores data and generates a response for Frontend.

## Checkpoint 8: Creating the home feed on the UI

### Task 1: Fetch tweets from the backend
We need to make a request to the backend to get tweets. We have to make sure that we send cookies to the backend in our request. Without our cookie, the backend will not know who is requesting for this information and can reject our request.

### Task 2: Add the tweet data to the page!
After Task 1, we can insert the tweet data into our state. This will allow for tweets to show up.

### Task 3: Pass tweets to the TweetFeed component
Just like we can pass arguments to functions, we can pass props to components. Pass the tweets that we set in the state into this component as a prop.

## Checkpoint 9: Fetch the followers data on the server-side

### Task 1: Call the correct URL
The URL that we call is going to be at the route `/followers/:handle`. The user's handle is available in the `params` object that `getServerSideProps` is called with. And finally, the base URL is available as a constant in `BASE_URL`. Can you call the correct URL?

### Task 2: Send the followers data in props
We can pass this data as props to the component. Can you assign the followers data to the `users` key? It is available in `data.followers`.

### Task 3: What happens if we don't get the user data?
It's possible that the backend doesn't give us any followers data and crashes (for some reason). How would we handle this? Remember, we have handled the case where zero users are present.

### Task 4: Consume the `<UserList>` component
Can you use the `UserList` component to render the followers data now? The followers are available to us in the `users` prop.

## Checkpoint 10: Adding feature to like/un-like a tweet

### Backend

#### Task 1A: Add routes for 'liking' and 'un-liking' any tweet

Add appropriate routes for both actions, liking and un-liking a tweet.

#### Task 1B: Add controllers for 'like' and 'un-like' actions

Add controllers for the handling actions 'like' and 'un-like'.
The correct tables in the database must be updated, for each action.
Associate the controllers for liking and un-liking a tweet with the appropriate routes.

#### Task 2: Add appropriate error handling for the controllers

Return the correct response status codes for the controllers, and add error handling.

### Frontend
We will be using the like count and state of like, and use that for rendering and handling the UI

#### Task 1: Read the value of like count and state of like
* Use the appropriate value & setter from the store for like count
* Use the appropriate value & setter from the store for like state

#### Task 2: Use the values from above task to customize the UI
* Set the weight for Heart component based on value of like
* Customize the classes for Heart component based on value of like
* Show the number of likes text based on value of like

#### Task 3: Handle the click on like/unlike button, setup the request currently
* Handle onClick based on whether the tweet is already liked or not
* Use the correct HTTP method for the `/tweet/like/` route
* Use the correct Content-Type of the `tweet/like` route
* Update the like count and state of like onSuccess

#### Task 4: Find the correct position for handling button state. This is common scenario in FE where based on the state of the request, we update the UI
* For unlike tweet, enable/disable the button correctly before firing the request
* For unlike tweet, enable/disable the button correct after the request completes
* Set the disabled prop correctly based on already liked or not
